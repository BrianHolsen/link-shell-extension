                    The NTFS file system implemented in NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows XP64, and Windows7/8/10 supports a facility known as <b>hard links</b>
                    (referred to herein as <b>Hardlinks</b>). Hardlinks provide the ability to keep a single copy of a file yet have it
                    appear in multiple folders (directories).&nbsp;

                    They can be created with the POSIX command <b><i>ln</i></b> included <i>in</i> the Windows
                    Resource Kit, the <i>fsutil</i> command utility included in Windows XP or my command line
                    <a href="http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html">ln.exe</a> utility&nbsp;

                    Thus, using standard Windows facilities Hardlinks can only be created at
                    the command prompt, which can be tedious, especially when Hardlinks to multiple files are required or when
                    one only makes occasional use of Hardlinks.&nbsp;
                    Support for Junctions in standard Microsoft software offerings is even more limited than that offered for hardlinks.

                <p>
                    Link Shell Extension (LSE) provides for the creation of
                    <a href="#hardlinks">Hardlinks</a>, <a href="#junctions">Junctions</a>, 
                    <a href="#volumemountpoint">Volume Mountpoints</a>, 
                    and Windows7/8's <a href="#symboliclinks">Symbolic Links</a>,
                    (herein referred to collectively as Links) a folder <a href="#hardlinkclones">cloning process</a> that utilises
                    Hardlinks or Symbolic Links and a copy process taking care of Junctions, Symbolic Links, and Hardlinks.
                    LSE, as its name implies is implemented as a Shell extension and is accessed from Windows Explorer, or similar file/folder managers.
                    <br />

                    The extension allows the user to select one or many files or folders, then using the mouse, complete the creation of the required Links -
                    Hardlinks, Junctions or Symbolic Links or in the case of folders to create Clones consisting of Hard or Symbolic Links.

                    LSE is supported on all Windows versions that support NTFS version 5.0 or later, including Windows XP64
                    and Windows7/8/10. Hardlinks, Junctions and Symbolic Links are NOT supported on FAT
                    file systems, and nor is the Cloning and Smart Copy process supported on FAT file systems.

                </b> are used to refer what are often referred to as the right mouse button and the pop up menu that is displayed
                when that mouse button is pressed (often referred to as the context menu). Recognising that people swap the usage of their
                mouse buttons, Microsoft refer to the <i>primary </i>and <i> secondary </i>mouse buttons. We prefer to refer the mouse buttons as the
                <b>Select </b>button and the <b>Action </b>button;
                and rather than terms such as Context Menu, Shell Menu, Right Mouse Menu we use the term <b>Action </b>menu.

                    During installation Explorer.exe has to be restarted to make Link Shell Extension active.
                    This means that all pending operations with explorer.exe are interrupted, but with the
                    interactive install you can decide to postpone the explorer.exe restart. A dialog box
                    will give you the choices during installation.

                <b>Silent install</b><br />
                /S pops up no prompts during install. If the /S switch is used, explorer.exe will be restarted after installation, to make Link Shell Extension

                popup menu. It should be noted this feature is <b>only guaranteed to work in Windows Explorer</b>;
                many Explorer replacements implement an application specific white space action menu that is not readily

                Files can&nbsp;
                be hard linked to the same folder as the source folder. Because two directory entries cannot have the same name, LSE uses
                '$filename - Hardlink.$ext' as the name of the the new link.
                <br />
                <br />

                With Windows XP this behaviour is different and LSE behaves under XP accordingly: 'HardLink of $filename'

                LSE uses the same hydraulics as explorer when it comes to multiple
                '$filename - Hardlink': It uses numbers to enumerate the multiple hardlinks of one file in the same directory, e.g.
                <i>$filename - Hardlink (2).$ext.</i>
                <br /><br />
                With Windows XP this behaviour is different and the names are generated like <i>'Hardlink of $filename (2).</i>

                Junctions are created in the same way as Hardlinks, except that the
                Source Link is a folder rather than a file. Select a folder, click the right mouse button, choose
                <b>Pick Link Source</b> from the action menu, navigate to the destination folder, click the action button, open the

                Junctions are marked with a small piece of chain below the folder icon.

                Junctions can also be created via Drag and Drop when the selected folders are
                dragged with the action button pressed to a destination folder; when the right mouse button is released, select the
                <b>Drop Here ...</b> submenu and then <b>Junction.</b>

                <br />


                Junctions can be deleted by using the Delete commands from Explorer as usual, if Link Shell Extension is installed, because
                Link Shell Extension implements a so called CopyHook handler, which intercepts Explorers Delete commands, and thus fixes
                Explorers problems with junctions.
                <br />

                Link Shell Extension changes Delete commands from Explorer on Junctions to unlinking Junctions, and not deleting
                the content within a junction, which seems most logical.
                <br /><br />

                <b><a name="junctionwindows7">Windows7/8/10</a>:</b>
                With Windows Vista & Windows7/8/10 explorer is natively aware of Junctions, and no interception or CopyHook handler is necessary, Explorer
                simply works out of the box with junctions. This is also the reason why the <i>Delete Junction</i> menue does not show up on Vista and Windows7/8/10.
                <br /><br />

                To show the origin of a junction, the <a href="#referencecount">reference column</a> of a junction shows
                the path to which the selected junction links.

                Junctions are a powerful feature, but can also be a <b>dangerous feature</b> without
                Link ShellExtension precautions under Windows Version < Windows Vista. Nativly Explorer shipped with < Vista becomes unstable if you use normal delete or
                rename functions on junction folders. Windows Explorer will always terminate abruptly and depending on system settings,
                Windows XP may do likewise.
                <br />
                <br />

                <b>Overlay Icons for Junctions</b><br />
                To help distinguish junction folders from normal folders, an <b>overlay icon</b> is implemented
                on junctions that shows a small three link chain icon under the folder.
                <br />

                Junctions can <b>span network drives</b> as long as the target is a mapped network drive.
                Unfortunately Junctions, which have a UNC Path as target, can be created
                with LSE, but even Vista seems to contain a bug, which prevents it from
                dereferencing a UNC Path in a junction, even if LSE correctly sets up
                the reparse info for UNC junctions. When a UNC target junction is
                double clicked in explorer the error ERROR_INVALID_REPARSE_DATA(4392), will
                show up and tell you that the info in the reparse point is illegal, even if
                it is not.
                <br />
                <br />

                <b>@Microsoft</b>: Why didn't you enable this feature for junctions, even if the syntax
                for UNC junctions is defined: \??\UNC\server\share. Any help appreciated.
                <br />
                <br />

                <b>With Vista and Windows7/8/10</b> some folders, e.g. c:\Program Files needs elevation for junctions
                beeing created in. This is why the <a href="#VistaAndUAC">famous UAC</a> dialog must be acknowledged.
                <br />

                To be exact: Only the creation of directories needs elevation in such situations, but creating
                an empty directory is a vital part of creating a junction. The DeviceIoControl(), which
                does the real work in creating junctions would work without elevation.

                Smart Copy is a must if e.g.. the whole content of a hard disk, which has lots of
                hardlinks/junctions/symbolic links, should be copied to another hard disk. During
                the Smart Copy operation empty folders get copied too and the date/time stamps of
                folders/junctions/symbolic links are also restored at the corresponding destination
                locations.
                <br />
                <br />

                Because Smart Copy creates inner hardlinks/junctions/symbolic links, this feature
                is only available on NTFS volumes.
                <br />
                <br />

                If Smart Copy takes longer than 250msec a progressbar shows the status of the smart
                copy operation.
                <br />
                <br />

                Smart Copy also processes all available alternative NTFS streams of a file.
                <br />
                <br />

                If items are already available in the destination, Smart Copy only copies when the
                Files/Symbolic/Junctions/MountPoints are newer than the already existing items.

                When restoring Symbolic links under Windows7/8/10 and Windows Vista, LSE forks its helper
                LSEUacHelper.exe to forwards this operation to it, because the creation of symbolic links
                needs elevation, and thus brings up the <a href="#VistaAndUAC">famous UAC</a> dialog.
                <br />
                <br />

                LSE <b>only</b> issues its helper LSEUacHelper.exe if a symlink is among/below the selected
                folders, so it saves you from one UAC prompt if you don't have symlinks among your
                selection.
                <br />
                <br />

                Smart Copy by default creates <a href="#relativevsabsolutesymboliclinks">relative</a> symbolic
                links during the Smart Copy operation.

                            is a inner junction with respect to <i>Outer Junction/Symlink Target</i>, the junction/symlink
                            relation is restored in the destination.

                            In the above example <i>Folder1</i> is copied to <i>Destination/Folder1</i>, and
                            <i>Outer Junction/Symlink</i> and is unrolled as expected, but then it starts to
                            get fascinating, because we have two levels of outer junctions/symlinks which all
                            have respective inner junctions/symlinks, and which are restored properly. Once
                            you digged yourself through the above picture, you got it. It is not simple I know,
                            but it is necessary to properly unroll.

                            And complexity increases if <b>symbolic link files</b> are within unrolled outer
                            junctions/symbolic links:

                            In the above example <i>Folder1</i> is copied to <i>Destination/Folder1</i>, and
                            <i>Outer Junction/Symlink</i> and is unrolled as expected, but it contains <i>Inner Outer Symlink</i> which points to <i>Inner Outer Symlink Target</i> and this is
                            a inner junction/symbolic link with respect to <i>Outer Junction/Symlink Target</i>
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            But worth mentioning is the Symbolic Link <i>Outer Symlink</i>, which would be a
                            definitive outer symbolic link, but since its targets parent-directory <i>Outer Junction/Symlink Target</i> is unrolled,
                            <i>Outer Symlink</i> becomes an inner symbolic link with respect to <i>Folder1</i>.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <i>File1 Symlink</i> is also a outer symbolic link, but its target parent-directory
                            <i>Folder2</i> is not that lucky to get unrolled, so in the destination <i>File1 Symlink</i>
                            is not a symbolic link any more, but a copy of the symbolic links' target.

                            <b>Nested Reparse Points</b> are also an interesting use case, which the algorithm has to tackle with:

                            In the above example <i>Folder1</i> is copied to <i>Destination</i>, and
                            <i>Junction/Symlink F0</i> and is unrolled as expected, but it contains inner
                            nested reparse points. <i>Nested</i> means Reparse point pointing to Reparse Points

                            The Unroll functionality also opens up the possibility to have <b>circular</b> Junction/Symbolic
                            Link relations among a set of copied items:
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            In the above example <i>Folder1</i> is copied via the --unroll option to <i>Destination/Folder1</i>.
                            Smart Copy/Smart Mirror and Delorean Copy operations can deal with the above shown
                            circularities and break circularities by not following the affected Junction/Symbolic
                            Link.

                            Junctions/Symbolic Links can also point to FAT drives or other NTFS drives requiring
                            as a prerequisite unique Disk-IDs on all disks, which are chained together via Junctions/Symbolic
                            links:

                            <br />
                            Hardlink siblings are found by matching the per NTFS volume uniqe file-id, but if
                            more volumes are chained together it might happen that the same file-ids can be
                            found on two different NTFS volumes. To address this all operations use the disk-id
                            and the file-id to match hardlink siblings.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Furthermore it is not allowed to have the disk-id 0xffff-ffff, because the algorithms
                            use this as internal indicator of a FAT drive.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            The Unroll option also allows to point multpile junctions to the same target location,
                            which causes the algorithms to traverse the same items many times:
                            <br />

                            At the first glance multiple traversation of items looks simple, but for files this
                            means that multiple traversed files are the same in the destination and are hardlinked
                            together. So don't be confused when you see hardlinks, which have never ever been
                            there before.

                            Copying Junction/Symbolic Links from mapped network drives also needs extra care, because
                            junctions on the remote machine relate with path references only valid on the remote machine
                            to each other:

                            The example in the above picture shows such a situation
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    X:\Src\Foo\Junction/Symlink is a junction on a Remote Machine, which points to X:\Src\Foo\Folder.
                                    It is a valid Junction.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    X:\Src\Foo is sharded via \\RemoteMachine\MyShare, which still is no problem.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    \\RemoteMachine\MyShare mapped to T:\ on a local machine is fine, but the Junction T:\Junction/Symlink,
                                    if asked for its target, will still return X:\Src\Foo\Folder even on the Local Machine. One could expect
                                    that the target is T:\Folder, but it is not for Junctions.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When SmartCopy/Mirror/Delorean comes across such a situation, it translates the Junction correctly when
                                    it is copied onto the Local Machines drive Y:\, so that the final Junction target points correctly to
                                    Y:\Dest\Bar\Folder
                                </li>

                    The Smart Move functionality is integrated into Explorer seamlessly, so that you don't have to
                    do anything special. Simply drag a folder in explorer to its destination location, or e.g. press F2
                    in Explorer to rename a directory and LSE will intercept this operation under the hood, takes care of
                    junctions or symbolic links, and will update them.
                <p>

                    Intercepting move and rename operation means, that LSE takes over control before rename/move, and recursivley
                    searches the selected folder for junctions or symbolic links. But searching large amounts of files and
                    folders takes time, so LSE will show a progress bar when searching takes longer than 250msec.

                <p>
                    HardLink and Symbolic Link Clones can also be created via Drag and Drop, select a folder and drag
                    with the action button depressed to a destination folder. When the action button
                    is released open the <b>Drop Here...</b> submenu and select <b>HardLink Clone</b>

                <p>
                    HardLink or Symbolic Link Clones are useful if you need to replicate
                    a folder tree at a different location. The disk space required is minimal because
                    the new structure consists entirely of NTFS directory entries with no real amount
                    of actual data storage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If both files and
                    folders are selected as Source Links and dropped as a
                    <b>HardLink Clone</b> then the selected files are dropped
                    as Hardlinks alongside the HardLink Clones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because Clones use Hardlinks or Symbolic Links, they are only available within an NTFS volume.
                    Hardlink Cloning can not replicate the folder structure from one disk volume to a
                    different volume, because Hardlinks are limited to operation on a single volume.
                    Symbolic Link Clones can be used to create volume spanning Clones, but only on Vista or Windows7/8/10
                </p>

                <p>
                    When creating Clones under Windows7/8/10 and Windows Vista, LSE forks its
                    helper LSEUacHelper.exe to forwards this operation to it, if the folder tree
                    contains <a href="innerjunction">symbolic links</a>, because the creation of
                    symbolic links needs elevation, and thus brings up the
                    <a href="#VistaAndUAC">famous UAC</a> dialog. <br />
                    LSE <b>only</b> issues its helper LSEUacHelper.exe if a symlink is among/below the selected
                    folders, so it saves you from one UAC prompt if you don't have symlinks among your selection.

                copy of <i>Source</i> only consisting of either hardlinks to <i>InitialBackup</i>,
                or of copied files if there was the need to copy them over from <i>Source(t+1)</i>
                because they were newer under <i>Source(t+1)</i>.

                The point is that all files in <i>Backup1</i> are transparently accessible, but
                really little space is used, because not all files in the <i>Source(t+1)</i> changed,
                so that there was only the need to effectively copy over a few files from <i>Source(t+1)</i>

                    DeLorean Copies are created in the same way as e.g Junctions. Select a folder,

                <br /><p>
                    If a DeLorean Copy was dropped the first time onto a directory, the operations, which are described under
                    phase 1 in the above descriptions, namely a Smart Copy, is performed. Link Shell Extension automatically
                    generated the folder name for the destination by appending a timestamp.<br />
                <p>

                    Any successive drop of a directory onto the a destination directory initates Phase 2 and Phase 3 from the
                    above description, namley it does the Hardlink Clone from the former backup onto the current backup and
                    furthermore does mirror the source onto the current backup.<br />

                    <b>Limitations</b><br />
                    It is little known, but NTFS has a limit to create a maximum of 1023 hardlinks to one file. For
                    DeLorean Copy this means that it will display an error message if this limit is exceeded, because
                    exceeding this limit means loss of data among the most recent backup sets:<br /><br />

                    <img src="delorean1024exceed.png" alt="Delorean Exceed 1023 Hardlink Limit" />

                <p>
                    <br />
                    The reason for exceeding this limit could either be, that there have been more than 1023 backup sets
                    but no hardlinks within the <i>Source</i>, or there are hardlinks within the <i>Source</i> and less than 1023
                    backup sets.

                <p>
                    <br />
                    The DeLorean Copy submenue will <b>not</b> appear if <b>more than one</b> folders are selected as source.
                <p>
                    <br />

                    DeLorean Copy is long path safe which means it can handle more than 256 characters in pathes. This is
                    important, because placing a copy with quite long path, but still below 256 characters path length,
                    to destination locations might result in combined path length greater than 256 character. In such a situation
                    no data loss must happen, which Delorean copy guaranties with beeing 'long path safe'.
                    Please make sure that Explorer can not show you the result of such a copy, but the files are there.
                    Alternative explorers like <a href="http://www.speedproject.de/">SpeedCommander</a> can handle this.

                    The target of a symbolic link can either be

                    </ul>
                    LSE by default tries to create <b>relative</b> target path names for symbolic links as long as
                    this is possible, e.g the file and its target are on the same logical drive.
                    Having relative symbolic link targets is much smarter especially when the target of links
                    is in the same directory.
                    If a symbolic link and its target are on different drives, LSE uses absolute pathnames.

                    With Vista and Windows7/8/10 it is possible to enumerate
                    all hardlink siblings to a file in constant time. Simply select a hardlinked file and select

                Unfortunately this feature is currently only available with Vista
                since the Win32 API calls to enumerate hardlinks are not available with XP or W2K.
                <p>
                    Under XP reading and processing the unique file ID of all filenames on a disk
                    is necessary to gather the same information. Since this operation is timeconsuming,
                    the siblings of a hardlinked file are not shown immediately after opening
                    the properties tab, but the 'Enumerate Siblings' button must be pressed.

                    Enumeration of all siblings under XP can take time, because in the worst case all
                    files contained on a logical volume must be at least opened for the filename.

                    One of the major Windows7/8/10 changes was the so called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/AccProtVista.asp">User Account Control (UAC)</a>. 
                    Due to UAC some API calls need elevation to administrative level, and this elevation must be acknowledged via the below shown dialog box. Unfortunately,
                    and I still can't believe this, the API call CreateSymbolicLink is a call, which needs elevation, and thus causes this annoying dialog box come up every time a symbolic
                    link is created.<br />
                    
                    So if you see the below box, and the program asking for elevation is LSEUacHelper.exe, it is Link Shell Extensions contribution to UAC and you must acknowledge it to get
                    Symbolic Links created.

                <p>
                    UAC will be the reason, that many applications simply either will not work, or are not useable with Windows7/8/10. They are not useable, because
                    privileged API calls and non privileged API calls are mixed in the code, and first need to be separated by architectural means into an separate .exe, which gets elevated,
                    and an .exe for the rest of the coding.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many applications will simply fail, because calls like CreateProcess(), which are very common, do not work, if the process started with it needs elevation. Well the
                    story goes on and on, and Link Shell Extension is a very small application, but to walk the learning curve was a hard way, especially because the documentation
                    was rather difficult to get.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I guess the main protection of UAC is that many small legacy apps are impossible to rewrite for Windows7/8/10, and they simply can not be used with Windows7/8/10 efficiently.

                It is little known, but the SMB networking protocol supports  operations to
                create remote Hardlinks, Junctions and Symbolic Links within SMB mapped
                network NTFS drives.
                <p>
                    This feature is used by Link Shell Extension, to enable the creation of
                    so called Remote Hardlinks, Remote Junctions, or Remote Symbolic Links. e.g.
                    <br />

                        <li>Pick a file from that share</li>
                        <li>Drop the file as Hardlink within the same share</li>

                Furthermore SMB1.0 also reports the reference count for Hardlinks and
                the junction origin for Junctions, which enables Link Shell Extension
                to show the properties dialog for remote files. Currently the reference
                count of a hardlink is reported via SMB1.0 in 90% correctly, so please
                be aware of this restriction.<p>

                    <b>@Microsoft</b>: Why does this happen in 90%? I have scanned my code
                    in the meantime many times, and it is obvious, that the same call

                    LSE supports both, mapped network drives and UNC paths.
                <p>
                    Mapped but not available network drives can in general be the reason
                    for sloppy explorer startup performance. Delays of a few seconds can
                    be experienced if explorer has to check all drive mappings, especially
                    the ones which are not available. This gets worse, if LSE also checks the status
                    of all drives.

                    To workaround this caveat the Remote Capabilities of Link Shell Extension

                    behaviour for hardlinks:
                <p>

                    SMB1.0: Windows XP, Windows2000 ... <br />
                    SMB2.0: Windows Vista ... <br />

                    All of those version support the creation of hardlinks remotely, but since SMB2.0 one
                    can not find out if a file on a remote drive is a hardlink or not.
                <p>

                    This means, that e.g if you connect with your Windows XP machine to a SMB2.1 drive,
                    which is provided by a Windows7/8/10 machine, you will not be able to see overlay icons

                LSE supports removable media, which have been formatted with NTFS, to create all kind of features it does for fixed drives too. The only limitation
                is that it intentionally won't work on removable media if they are mounted to drive A: or B:. The reason is that A: or B: are commonly used for floppy drives.
                <p>
                    With removable media formatted to NTFS there is the slight chance that LSE reports
                    'Access denied' problems, when creating hardlinks or junctions. This is due to
                    file object permissions on the removable NTFS drive, which have been created with a different
                    computer on that removable media, thus causing this 'Access denied' messages. The solution
                    here is to change the permission on that removable media as Administrator.

                    Technically it seems that NTFS5 even shipped with WindowsXP has always supported symbolic links, but the functionality was
                    not available for user mode applications, and even not for the upper layers of ntfs.sys

                <p>
                    <b>BUT:</b> There are filter drivers available from Masatoshi Kimura for even WindowsXP, which enable symbolic links
                    under XP. These drivers can be downloaded from his home page for <a href="http://emk.name/symlink-1.06-x64.zip">64 bit</a> and for
                    <a href="http://emk.name/symlink-1.06-x86.cab">32 bit</a>. 
                    The <a href="http://emk.name/symlink-1.06-src.zip"> sources</a> are also available.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Installation of these drivers is also quite simple.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unpack the archive for your plattform, </li>

                        <li>
                            Open a command shell with administrator access privileges on a directory,
                            containing both, senable.exe and symlink.sys, to run following commands:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>senable.exe install</b> </li>
                                copies the driver symlink.sys to %systemroot%\system32\drivers, registers it at
                                HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SymLink and starts it.
                                <li><b>senable.exe delete</b> </li>
                                deletes the driver symlink.sys from %systemroot%\system32\drivers and registry,
                                but nothing more. Once copied to %systemroot%\system32\drivers and registered, it
                                still needs to be activated by seneable.exe on each Windows start. To unload the
                                driver after deletion you need to reboot Windows, logoff is not enough.
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    To start the symbolic link driver automatically, change the registry value HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SymLink\Start from 2 (automatic) to 0 (boot).
                    From now on, symlinks automatically become working after each Windows start, even if directly logged into your limited account.

                    Link Shell Extension enables its complete symbolic link functionality under XP as soon as it finds
                    this driver loaded. And, sensation(!): There is no UAC prompt necessary under XP for creating symbolic links ;-))

                    With Windows Server 2012 Microsoft introduced the

                    filesystem, which is the designated successor to NTFS. But the first
                    implementation of ReFS can do nice things, but lacks a few important features from NTFS like the Hardlink support.
                    <br />

                    Link Shell Extension supports ReFS so that one can create Symbolic Links, Mountpoints, Junctions on ReFS volumes.
                    But it will throw an error message if a hardlink is about to be created on a ReFS volume. So what are the impacts on
                    Link Shell Extension in detail:
                    <ul>
                        <li>ReFS drives as the destination of <a href="#deloreancopy">Delorean Copies</a> will for sure fail, at least when creating the second backup in a Delorean set.</li>

                        <li>SmartMove will work.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Since ReFS is expected to support the full set of NTFS functionality in a later release, Link Shell Extension has no
                    checks implemented to tackle with the above constraints.

                    otherwise certain operations will fail.

                    For all other resolutions smaller than 256x256, Vista works in the same way as XP, you have
                    to prepare an overlay icon in the lower left corner.
                <p>
                    Furthermore Vista icons should not be saved 'compressed', because XP can not read compressed icons.

                <a name="hardlinks"><b>Hardlinks</b></a> are a feature common to many Unix based systems, but are not directly available with
                NT4/W2K/WXP. It is a feature, which must be supported by the file system of the operating system.

                <p>
                    So what are Hardlinks? It is common to think of a file as being an association between a <i>file name</i> and a <i>
                    data object</i>. Using Windows Explorer, the file system can be readily browsed, showing a 1:1 relationship between the
                    <i>file name</i> and the <i>data object</i>, but this 1:1 relationship does not hold for all file systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some file systems, including UFS, XFS, and NTFS have a N:1 relationship between <i>file name</i> and the <i>data object</i>, 
                    hence there can be more than one directory entry for a file.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, how does one create multiple entries for the same data object? In Unix there is a command line utility <i>ln</i>, which is used to
                    create link entries for existing files, hence there are many file names, or so called Hardlinks, for the one data object.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For each HardLink created, the file system increments a reference count
                    stored with the <i>data object</i>, i.e. it stores how many <i>file names</i> refer to the data object, this counter is
                    maintained (by the file system) within the data object itself. When a file name referencing a <i>data object is</i> deleted, the <i>data object&#8217;s</i> reference
                    count is decremented by one. The <i>data object</i> itself <b>only</b> gets deleted when the reference count is decremented to zero.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reference count is the only way of determining whether there are multiple <i>file name</i> references to a <i>data object</i>, and it
                    only informs of their number NOT there whereabouts.
                </p>

                    <a name="junctions"><b>Junctions</b></a>
                    are wormholes in the tree structure of a directed graph. By browsing a Junction a maybe far distant location in the file system is made
                    available. Modifying, Creating, Renaming and Deleting files within a junction tree structure operates at the junction
                    target, i.e. if you delete a file in a Junction it is deleted at the original location.

                <p>
                    <a name="symboliclinks"><b>Symbolic Links</b></a> 
                    are to files what Junctions are to folders in that they are both transparent and Symbolic. Transparency means that an application can
                    access them just as they would any other file, Symbolism means that the data objects can reside on any available
                    volume, i.e. they are not limited to a single volume like Hardlinks. Symbolic Links differ from Shortcuts in that
                    they offer a transparent pathway to the desired data object, with a shortcut (.lnk), something has to read and
                    interpret the content of the shortcut file and then open the file that it references (i.e. it is a two step
                    process). When an application uses a symlink it gains immediate access to the data object referenced by the
                    symlink (i.e. it is a one step process).
