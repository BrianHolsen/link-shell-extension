Quick Guide to Processes.dll
--------------
Processes.dll is a plugin to Nsis, and contains useful functions needed during install.
To use it, copy it to NSIS/plugins directory

There are a few helpers inside processes.dll, which are unique to LSE

ProcessEnumModules_<platt>.exe
----------
This is an .exe, which is kept as a binary resource in processes.dll, and is extracted during setup and executed.
Why that complicated: The installer is a 32bit process, and we need to enumerate modules used by 64bit proceses. This only works if you have 
a 64bit process, and that's why it is extracted during run-time from 32bit processes.dll and executed via fork as 64bit process.
It writes a file LseInstallerCollidingProcesses.txt as output, which is read by processes.dll and returned to the installer. Rather old-school, but works

We have to find out the processes, which have loaded hardlinkshellext.dll, and thus prevent it from beeing deleted and installed.

VCredistProbe_<platt>.exe
-----------
It is hard to find out if the redistributeables are properly installed on a system. The only way, which came to my mind is to
execute a program, which needs the redistributeables, and see if process creation worked. This is what VCredistProbe_<platt>.exe does.


ProcessesTest
--------
This is a small .exe which uses processes.dll and allows debugging of functionality in processesd.ll without
going the full way to an InstallationSet


How to build
----------
Build ProcessEnumModules and VCredistProbe first. Copy the output to 
processes\ProcessEnumModules_x64.exe
processes\ProcessEnumModules_win32.exe
processes\VCredistProbe_x64.exe
processes\VCredistProbe_win32.exe

Compile processes.dll and copy processes.dll to NSIS/plugins
