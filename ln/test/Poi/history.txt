Comment:    Made changes in the datasource, so it is like in POI 5.6.1. Normcode DS only 
            requests the values which are displayed in table.
			Inserted a new entry in poi.ini under settings called DBLIMITWARN. It gives the database 
			limit in percent when a warning message should be issued. So if the database for instance 
			has a filling level of 80 percent, a exception is issued.

Comment:    It can happen that PUMA is sending slices which are not correct, so a message
            BSLICE ERROR: slice extends beyond bslice is displayed in the debugwindow. 
			If this happens POI still tries to interpret the slice, so no reinit is needed,
			but still information can be lost!
			Made changes in open desktop, so that it displays the window with correct size.

Comment:    In modeless dialogs, there was a problem that it was not possible to get back to
            the dialog via keyboard. To solve this, internal a timer is set up with a timeout period
			of x seconds. There is a Poi.ini entry in settings called USEAUTOFOCUSONDLG This timer is triggered, 
			when the dialog loses focus. If the timer expires,
			the dialog looks if POI is activated and if so it comes again into foreground.

Comment:    Improved focus handling for mouseless, new entry in settings called USEKEYBOARD. If set than Poi
            tries to use the keyboard for switching from one control to the next and so on. The limitations are
			when there is an activex control inside, the controls sometimes didn't give back focus.
